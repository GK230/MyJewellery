        <h6><a name="60sring">60s Ring</a></h6>
        <p class="inspiration-text">
            This is my first creation and therefore dear to my heart. The brief was to create a bezel set ring with a texture.
            I was inspired my a photo of my mother, carrying me,
            taken in the 1970s. She was wearing what I would describe as a pyschadelic sari, with a pattern of circles. I found a bag
            of sequins of different sized circles and decided to recreate the design. My parents used to run an Indian jewellery business
            and arrived in 'Swinging London' in the Swingin '60s from Uganda. This first design of mine is a sort of homage to all of that.
            It is completed with a very hippyish moonstone.

        <h6><a name="mr">Motherboard Ring</a></h6>
        <p class="inspiration-text">
            This ring is based on the same brief as above. I was practising acid etching and was trying out many designs, when I realised that like leaves
            and other items I was using, they were similar to a computer motherboard.I realised that the light on the motherboard could be an orange stone.
            I therefore copied a design of a motherboard and resized it and added the stone. I have been programming since the age of 9/10, and I am writing
            this as part of one of my assignments for "CS50" - Harvard University's Introduction to Computer Science course which I am currently taking.

        <h6><a name="pp">Psychadelic Pendant</a></h6>
        <p class="inspiration-text">
            I still had that bag of sequins I had discovered lying around the house and I decided to add some nail art sequins to add to my collection.
            The brief was to use non-traditional material as part of a pendant. Continuing the sixties theme, I was inspired to create this pendant
            out of resin and nail art sequins.

        <h6><a name="psp">Polypropylene-Set Pendant</a></h6>
        <p class="inspiration-text">
            Working on the same brief as above, it was difficult for me to use non-traditional or modern materials, as that was not what I had grown up
            or been brought up to use, and really I was a fan of working with metal. This was my inspiration for this pendant. It is in fact a traditional
            techinique, where I have actually set polypropylene into silver. I was thinking about plastic and the brief and this is how I came up with this idea
            - the value of polypropylene.
